With the growing societal need to enhance science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instruction in classrooms and beyond, there is a call for integrated learning programs that allow teachers to engage students meaningfully in STEM, especially at the elementary and middle school levels. With that in mind, we have developed the VEX IQ Curriculum as a companion to the VEX IQ platform for elementary and middle school students. The curriculum offers twelve flexible units of instruction that can be used in sequence, in chunks, or as standalone lessons.
